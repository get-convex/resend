# Example Resend component deployment

It's a simple one. The meat is in the `convex/` directory. If you want to fire it up, here's how:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Grab a Resend api key and webhook secret and set them in your deployment environment.
3. Go mess around in your Convex dashboard with `testBatch`. There is no UI!
